// Level of a tree = height of a tree

// Height of a node : Number of edges in longest path from node to leaf
// Level of a node : the number of edges along the unique path between it and the root node
// Level of root = 0

// Full/Proper/Strict Binary Tree - A tree with each node having 0 or 2 node 
   // OR only leaf node has 0 degree else have degree of 2

// Complete Binary Tree - All the levels are completely filled (except possibly the last level ) 
//                        and the last level has nodes as left as much as possible

// Perfect Binary Tree - All internal nodes have two children and all leave nodes are at same level
